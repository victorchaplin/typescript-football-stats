# typescript-football-stats

- using enums for fixed values
- using tuples for mapping types
- explored a refactor using class inheritance and generics
- explored a refactor using object composition
- composition over inheritance was chosen
- using static methods to reduce coupling (maybe there's some better solution? probably...)
